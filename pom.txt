Test Framework is software, which will enable us to run our tests as needed. There are two most common frameworks:

JUnit
TestNG

Both the framework are used for unit testing. 
TestNG is similar to JUnit with few more additional functionality. 
TestNG provides parallel execution, grouping, parameterization and dependency which are not available in JUnit. 
It also provides reporting in HTML & XML format.

Our choice of test automation framework is TestNG.
